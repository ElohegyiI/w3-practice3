				<h1>Basketball is fun</h1>
					<p>James and Durant, as the leading vote-getters in each conference, will be the captains who draft players for the rosters for the Feb. 20 game in Cleveland.
					James, who began his NBA career with the Cavaliers in 2003 and led them to the 2016 championship during his second stint there, was chosen as an All-Star for the 18th straight time. He has been a captain every year since the league went away from the East vs. West format.
					LeBron James will again captain the All-Star team for the Western Conference.
					Durant’s availability for the game is in doubt because of a sprained knee ligament. He was voted a starter for the 10th time, while Bucks forward Antetokounmpo was voted in for a sixth consecutive time, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s franchise record for selections.

			<p>No longer are the Memphis Grizzlies an “over-looked team.”
			Ja Morant earned his first NBA All-Star appearance. The Memphis Grizzlies (38-15) are third in the Western Conference and, judging by the latest entries for the NBA mailbag, there is far more intrigue about the team outside of Beale Street than even the NBA’s “glamour” franchise in Los Angeles.			
			That development might also have to do with the fatigue Lakers fans feel about the team’s never-ending injuries and consistency. But it also has to do with the deserved respect the Grizzlies are finally receiving.
			So without a delay, here are a few of those Grizzlies-related questions. No longer are the Memphis Grizzlies an “over-looked team.”
